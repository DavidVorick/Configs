Configs
=======

This is a file containing all of the configurations that I use on my laptop. It's partially for me, partially to share with the world (in case I ever make an 'install gentoo' guide). My laptop is a t540p, with an SSD, 4GB of RAM, and a resolution of 2880x1600. My goals for this system are to boot using uefi exclusively, while using full disk encryption, and to have a completely custom initramfs. All those have been accomplished. I also want to use Plymouth as a bootsplash/animation, but I haven't figured that part out yet. All the guides I've found use Dracut or Genkernel, which means I'd have to give up my custom initramfs.
